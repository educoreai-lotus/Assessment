### Usage

1. Follow the numbered templates in sequence (01-09)
2. Use the main development flow template as an overview
3. AI-generated artifacts will be stored in the `artifacts/` directory
4. Each template includes checklists and guidance for its respective phase

### Development Phases

1. **Initial Development Setup** - Project initialization and environment setup
2. **User Dialogue and Requirements** - Requirements gathering and analysis
3. **Feature Planning** - Feature prioritization and planning
4. **Design and Architecture** - System design and technical specifications
5. **Security Compliance** - Security requirements and compliance
6. **AI Design Prompt** - AI-assisted development prompts
7. **Implementation** - Code development and implementation
8. **Testing and Verification** - Comprehensive testing and validation
9. **Code Review and Deployment** - Final review and production deployment
