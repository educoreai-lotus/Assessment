# Cursor Execution Rules for Assessment-Tests Project
# These rules guide GPT in Cursor to execute your 9 templates automatically.

- Always follow: /templates/Main-Project-Development-Flow.md
- Run phases strictly in numeric order (01 → 09)
- For each active phase:
  - Load and execute only the referenced .md template
  - Output artifacts only to /artifacts/
  - Use append-only versioning (no overwriting)
- Ask at most one clear question at a time if any information is missing
- Never request code input from the user; generate everything automatically when a phase requires it
- All answers and generated files must follow the structure defined in the templates
- Stop when the Exit Criteria or Success Criteria for a phase are met
- Maintain ROADMAP.json as the central tracking file for all phases
- All actions and generated files must be logged or versioned in /artifacts/
